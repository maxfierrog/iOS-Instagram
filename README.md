# Instagram

Instagram is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend. I mainly meant for this to be an introduction to storing user data msyelf, so the app around the basic functionality is barebones.

## Features

- [X] Log in and log out of your account
- [X] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [X] Take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
