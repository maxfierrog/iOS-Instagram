# Project 3 - Instagram

Instagram is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

## User Stories

The following functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [X] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [X] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [X] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [X] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [X] User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [X] User can tap a post to view post details, including timestamp and caption
- [X] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [X] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
- [X] Display the profile photo with each post

Some things I could work on are:

- [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page
- [ ] Run your app on your phone and use the camera to take the photo
- [ ] User can load more posts once he or she reaches the bottom of the feed using infinite scrolling
- [ ] User can use a Tab Bar to switch between a Home Feed tab (all posts) and a Profile tab (only posts published by the current user)
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse
- [ ] User can comment on a post and see all comments for each post in the post details screen
- [ ] User can like a post and see number of likes for each post in the post details screen
- [ ] Style the login page to look like the real Instagram login page
- [ ] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed
- [ ] Implement a custom camera view
